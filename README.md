Silver.CV - Web3 Programming and Marketing Training Center for Startups

From the heart of the MENA region, we are building an open project that makes Web3 tools accessible to everyone.

The Idea

Silver.CV is a training center focused on empowering individuals to learn programming and understand Web3 technologies, offering specialized programs in Arabic, including smart contracts, decentralized application development, and digital marketing for Web3-based projects.

Why Silver.CV?

Because digital literacy is a right for everyone.

Because our region deserves training content in its own language and environment.

Because Web3 is the future of the internet, and we must be part of its industry, not just its users.

The Challenge

As a founder, I worked on building focused content, designing the program, and attracting interested parties from the region. We are trying to seek support from institutions concerned with digital empowerment. The real challenge? Resources. The estimated cost exceeds 30,000 euros, and self-funding is limited.

 Open Call

We are opening this project to all programmers, marketers, and trainers to contribute to its development and promote Web3 in our language and identity. We also welcome organizations like the Ethereum Foundation or anyone who believes in the importance of decentralized education.
